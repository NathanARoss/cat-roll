# The food dispenser went off.  Time to roll

Simple three.js game to have some fun.  I haven't programmed anything graphical or non-work related in ages.

Think Marble Blast Gold or Marble It Up! as examples for intended gameplay.  As an initial concept, I imagine the game starts with a view of a food dispenser going off, then the camera pulls back forwards the screen (south?) to show a very round cat model ready to roll forward towards the dispensed food.  The game is not meant to be challenging or fully developed, but just some fun to develop and show friends.  Maybe a level can have a 2nd opponent cat you have to race against to get to the food bowl first.
